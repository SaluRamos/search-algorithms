# SORTING AND SEARCHING ALGORITHMS
This project is a study of famous algorithms
## Demonstration

1 - Running 'python3 main.py' will score and print all sorting algorithms

The sort algorithms are:
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Share Sort (first attempt to create 'merge sort')
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

The search algorithms are:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

**Obs:** The tim sort pontuation must have better performance because of list data type used (python sorted function)
